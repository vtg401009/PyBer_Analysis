# Pyber Analysis
(Summary of Ride Data)

Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze ride share data for V. Isualize in rural, suburban, and urban markets. By looking at total ride, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver, I was able to determine trends that will help executives make positive business level decisions.

Results:

The difference in ride sharing data between the different markets was clear - rural markets are obviously less utilized whereas urban markets are highly utilized. 

Looking at the graphs, it looks as though there is a peak in mid February for our customers, likely for  Valentine's Day. 

Also, in Urban communities, customers use is not steady late February through early April. 

Suburban communities remain stagnant apart from the sharp increase in February.

Summary:

From these results, I recommend the following:

1. Provide incentives for our drivers in Suburban communities - the customer base is constant and by focusing our efforts in this market, we will be able to increase profits and satisfaction for our drivers.

2. Increase rates during holidays - our customers use our services more on Holidays. Our drivers are the backbone of our business, to keep them working during the holidays, we can increase their pay during this time or offer bonuses if they meet certain quotas.

Push for hybrid vehicles in our rural communities - with the increase in the price of gasoline, we could incentivize our drivers with hybrid vehicles to focus their efforts in the rural market. Customers are using our ride services, however since demand is low, drivers willingness to drive in the rural market is low. If we push our hybrid drivers to work in the rural market, our customers will use more of our services.
